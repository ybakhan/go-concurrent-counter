## Go Concurrency Coding Challenge - Contiguous Counter
A basic HTTP server allows a local counter value to be incremented, set, and retrieved.  Your task is to ensure that this counter is incremented in sequential order.  This must happen regardless of how many counter increment requests are made in parallel.  To enable testing concurrent requests, an Apache Bench script has been included in this project.  So this challenge doubles as an introduction to concurrency testing.

## Using Apache Bench
Apache bench is pre-installed on most *nix, Unix, or Unix-like operating systems such as MacOS.  It's main purpose is to test HTTP servers.  In this use case, we'll use ab to test concurrent requests.  The -n parameter represents the number of requests, and the -c parameter is how many requests will be made at a time.  The concurrency count can't exceed the number of requests.  To normalize the challenge, use the script as-is for your final proof; but feel free to play around with the ab parameters. If you want to experiment, keep in mind that a large number of concurrent requests will overflow a local http server based on the configured maximum TCP connections or the file descriptor limit.  On some operating systems, this is difficult to change. If there's enough interest in this subject, a tutorial will be provided on how to change these limits in MacOS.  Keep in mind this is a concurrency challenge, not a performance one.  The missing performance features in this project's http server also contribute to the limited number of concurrent requests that can be made with the ab tool.

## Permissions for the shell script
You'll need to run 

```
chmod 755 ./ab-benchmark.sh
```

in order to execute this script with the appropriate permissions.

## Challenge Rules
You may use any means necessary to achieve an accurate counter increment, but the main() function must be left untouched. Using a new library (e.g. gin or gorilla mux) to rewrite the http server and endpoint handling is also not allowed.  The ab tool configured to make parallel requests must be the only thing used to make the increment requests to the HTTP server. Fork this repository or clone it, create your own remote repo from it, and when you're ready to submit your final solution, send me the URL.

## Bonus Points
Add a decrement endpoint to the HTTP server, and work out how to manage requests that are potentially incrementing and decrementing the counter at the same time.  Going for bonus points will allow you to add 

```http.HandleFunc("/decrement", dec)```

to the main() function, but all other rules still apply.

## Explainer For The Concurrency Concept
Concurrency is not parallelism. Concurrency is how multiple independent processes are composed, parallelism is the simultaneous execution of instructions.  From a CPU perspective, concurrency is scheduled at the single core level, and potentially using to other cores as needed (orchestrating many things at the same time).  Parallel execution, on the other hand, is decidedly handled by independent computations on multiple CPU cores (doing many things at the exact same time).  A good analogy is the juggler - concurrency is having two arms/hands and working with multiple balls up in the air. Parallelism is the juggler having 4 sets of arms/hands and juggling independent sets of balls simultaneously.  The parallel juggler doesn't even have to juggle sets of balls, just tossing one ball per hand displays their simultaneous handling ability.
